**24. Who I am?** `[24-answer.txt]` >> Ouput of the provided Python code.

**25. Tuple or not** `[25-answer.txt]` >> Ouput of the provided Python code.

**26. Empty is not empty** `[26-answer.txt]` >> Ouput of the provided Python code.

**27. Still the same?** `[27-answer.txt]` >> `Yes` or `No` to whether the provided Python code will print `139926795932424`.

**28. Same or not?** `[28-answer.txt]` >> `Yes` or `No` to whether the provided Python code will print `139926795932424`.

**29. #pythonic** `[100-magic_string.py]` >> Function `magic_string()` that returns a string “BestSchool” n times the number of the iteration.

**30. Low memory cost** `[101-locked_class.py]` >> Class `LockedClass` with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance attribute is called `first_name`.

**31. int 1/3** `[103-line1.txt, 103-line2.txt]` >> Number of int objects that are created by the execution of the fist (`103-line1.txt`) and second line (`103-line2.txt`) of the provided script, assuming CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration is used.

## 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing [0-positive_or_negative.py] >> Assigns a random signed number to the variable 'number'each time it is executed, printing whether the number stored is positive or negative
1. The last digit [1-last-digit.py] >> Assigns a random signed number to the variable 'number' each time it is executed, printing the last digit of the number stored
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game [2-print_alphabet.py] >> Prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off [3-print_alphabt.py] >> Prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
4. Hexadecimal printing [4-print_hexa.py] >> Prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
5. 00..99 [5-print_comb2.py] >> Prints numbers from 0 to 99
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need [6-print_comb3.py] >> Prints all possible different combinations of two digits
7. islower [7-islower.py] >> Checks for lowercase character
8. To uppercase [8-uppercase.py] >> Function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important [9-print_last_digit.py] >> Function that prints the last digit of a number
10. a + b [10-add.py] >> Function that adds two integers and returns the result
11. a ^ b [11-pow.py] >> Function that computes 'a' to the power of 'b' and return the value
12. Fizz Buzz [12-fizzbuzz.py] >> Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space
13. Insert in sorted linked list [13-insert_number.c, lists.h] >> Function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
14. Smile in the mirror [100-print_tebahpla.py] >> Prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line
15. Remove at position [101-remove_char_at.py] >> Function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position 'n' (not the Python way, the 'C array index)
16. ByteCode -> Python #2 [102-magic_calculation.py] >> Python function 'def magic_calculation(a, b, c):' that does exactly the same as the provided Python bytecode
